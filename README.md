# google-services.json
Before starting app it is required to put google-services.json file inside /frontend/libapp/android/app directory. Allowed users may obtain this file from firebase console. It is sensitive file and shouldn't be added to repository.

To get google-services.json first in Firebase console select "Lend me" project and then open settings of "Lend Me Android" application. Option to download google-services should be there.

# Facebook login
Logging with Facebook in app debug version requires each developer to generate Hash Key in their environment, which have to be then allowed in Facebook Application. So it may not work out of the box.
